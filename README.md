# XpathValidator

This tool will validate the Xpaths for the Given Json and Xml files , and print the values on the console.

I have made some changes in the java-json.jar to pick "content" as key in order to print content as node in the generated xpaths.

HOW TO USE ::
Copy the .jar files and the library, run the below command :

Json::  java -cp XpathValidator.jar XpathCheck  -json test.json -p "Xpath"
